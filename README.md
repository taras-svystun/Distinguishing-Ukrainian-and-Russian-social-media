# Distinguishing-Ukrainian-and-Russian-social-media

In the light of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the need for deeper study of the Russo-Ukrainian media space became apparent. Many studies that are now concentrating on such analysis lack a reliable and scalable (to thousands of posts) method for distinguishing Russia's propaganda and/or bot-generated content from the russian-language sources in Ukraine. This paper aims to make initial advancements into making an accurate and efficient model for such classification.

In particular, this research concentrates on the utility of distinguishing Russian and Ukrainian social media paragraphs with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). To this end, it proposes an optimal classification model based on LSA, performance- and accuracy-testing its various configurations based on popular semantic preprocessing methods. It then compares its performance to other popular Machine Learning classifiers, and makes a verdict on whether LSA classifiers show sufficient potential for further study.
